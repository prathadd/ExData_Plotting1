##How it all started

##All required data was read in a file named HW411.txt
Y <- read.csv2("HW411.txt")   ## Reading file in a variable
Y[,1] <- as.Date(dmy(Y[,1])) ## Converted factor to date format in first column of the data
Z <- paste(Y[,1], Y[,2]) ## Created single Date_Time entity in a new variable.
Z <- strptime(Z, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")  ## Converted into POSIXlt format (the standard one)
Date_Time <- strptime(Z, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", "Time")
X <- data.frame(Date_Time, Y[, c(3:9)]) ## New variable with Date_Time as first column and further columns are remaining data of original file. 

## This Variable "X" has been used for plotting of graphs 

## The plots are first created in Rstudio device and then exported and saved as image directly from the R, 
## and not through the code as such an option is available.
